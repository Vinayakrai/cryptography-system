# Cryptography System

**Cryptography System** is a Python-based application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text data. Built using the Tkinter library, this tool ensures that your sensitive information remains secure and unreadable to unauthorized parties.

## 🔐 Features

- **Text Encryption**: Convert plaintext into ciphertext using a custom algorithm.
- **Text Decryption**: Revert ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures that data cannot be read during transmission or storage.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `tkinter` (usually included with standard Python installations)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/cryptography-system.git
cd cryptography-system
```

2. **Run the Application**:

```bash
python encrypt-decrypt.py
```

The GUI window will appear, allowing you to input text for encryption or decryption.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Encrypting Text**:
   - Enter the plaintext into the designated input field.
   - Click the "Encrypt" button.
   - The encrypted ciphertext will be displayed.

2. **Decrypting Text**:
   - Enter the ciphertext into the designated input field.
   - Click the "Decrypt" button.
   - The original plaintext will be displayed.
